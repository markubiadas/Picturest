<p id="description">Picturest is a photo-based social media web application that was developed by three aspiring web developers. We were inspired to build this project because social media applications are a big part of everyone‚Äôs daily lives and sharing photos and other forms of media make up a big part of social media websites and how we connect with the world and share information. Pinterest is one of the biggest social media platform that exemplifies this and the inspiration behind Picturest's design.</p>

<h2>Demo</h2>

<h3>Registration & Login</h3>
<p>The user experience begins on the registration page. Once a user registers, they are redirected to the login page where they can log in. We implemented Spring Security for our web app, which gave us a more secure and  customizable way of implementing authentication, authorization, validation, and protection against common attacks, such as cross-site request forgery.</p>

<h3>Uploading a Photo via file upload</h3>
